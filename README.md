This project ...

### How To Compile the Compiler with ANT:
code examples of how to compile the compiler with ANT (the output from the usage target could be used here)

### How To Run the Compiler to Compile a .kc File:
code examples of how to run your compiler to compile a .kc file (like the examples above)

### Project Log:

Date | Team Member(s) | Hours | Summary of work session

October 3rd, 2019 | Max Bickley, Jacob Redmon, Chad Critchelow | Thirty minutes |  We created the grammar file, we created the Github account, and we established the contributors in the Github account.

October 4th, 2019 | Chad Critchelow | Thirty minutes | Copied over the four example KnightCode programs from the PDF to the server and pushed them to github. All KnightCode programs end with the ".kc" extension.

October 7th, 2019 | Max Bickley | Thirty minutes| Resolved the issue with ESC that prevented the grammar file from running.

October 8th, 2019 | Max Bickley | Two hours | Worked on the the ant file.

October 9th, 2019 | Max Bickley | Two hours |Completed the ant file.

October 10th, 2019 | Jacob Redmon | Five minutes | Added the proper build directories to knightcode.

October 13th, 2019 | Max Bickley | 2.5 hours | Worked towards setting up the framework for Mylistener.

October 13th, 2019 | Max Bickley | 2 hours | Successfully determined how to utilize parse trees and wrote each @Override response currently listed in Mylistener.

October 14th, 2019 | Max Bickley | 3 hours | Worked towards resolving errors regarding the ELSE statement being parsed before statements that were intended to be contained within the ELSE.

October 15th, 2019 | Max Bickley | 3 hours | Resolved an error where the Mylistener cannot determine whether or not to read input as string or integers. Resolved the error where all ELSE statements would be parsed before statements that were intended to be contained within the ELSE.

October 16th, 2019 | Max Bickley | 15 minutes | Modified the ant file and submitted it to Github.

October 20th, 2019 | Max Bickley | 3 hours | Finished the Mylistener, uploaded the Mylistener to Github, added terminators as a token in knightcode.g4, corrected the error where the ADD token had a ',' instead of a '+', and modified build.xml so that the compiler could store three arguments instead of only two.

October 21st, 2019 | Max Bickley | 8 minutes | Corrected a minor error in knightcode.g4 regarding the IF and ELSE statements where ENDIF recurred. Made a minor modification to Mylistener to remove an unnecessary method override.

October 22nd, 2019 | Max Bickley | 25 minutes | Replaced the method of determining where to parse read input as an Int or String with a much more robust method in Mylistener.

October 22nd, 2019 | Jacob Redmon | 1 hour | Researched methods of error handling and decided on a method to use in the project.

October 23rd, 2019 | Jacob Redmon | 1.5 hours | Cleaned and added the compiler, Mylistener and ErrorListener, updated README with proper formatting and documentation.

October 23rd, 2019 | Jacob Redmon | 1.5 hours | Created 4 knightcode files, made Errorlistener simpler

October 23rd, 2019 | Max Bickley & Ben Torrance | 4 hours | Created the ClassyCompiler.java file with comments and tested the compiler on the 8 knightcode programs. All test files should now translate and compile.
